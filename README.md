# EWC Ansible Role IPA Enroll Automation Via Morpheus

This repository contains a configuration template 
(i.e. an [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)) 
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).
Applying this template will trigger the configuration of [Morpheus](https://morpheusdata.com/) 
entities, enabling you to edit/automate management of EWC computer resources'
life cycle via a web-based graphical user interphase (GUI).

Assuming an [IPA server](https://www.freeipa.org/) is already provisioned 
and configured within your EWC environment, the template is designed to:
* Setup automation (i.e. Morpheus Workflow) such that:
  * Any and all new virtual machines created, via the Morpheus GUI, within
  a user-specified Morpheus Domain, will enroll onto the IPA server's
  provided DNS and LDAP services.
