# IPA Enroll/Disenroll Automation Ansible Playbook

This repository contains a configuration template
(i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).
Applying this template will trigger the configuration of [Morpheus](https://morpheusdata.com/)
entities, enabling you to edit/automate management of EWC computer resources'
life cycle via a web-based graphical user interphase (GUI).

Assuming an [IPA server](https://www.freeipa.org/) is already provisioned
and configured within the EWC environment, the template is designed to:
* Execute a one-time setup for automation (i.e. Morpheus Integration,
  Tasks, Workflow and Network Domain) such that:
  * New virtual machines created via the Morpheus GUI within
  a user-defined Morpheus Network Domain, will enroll onto a the IPA server's
  provided DNS and LDAP services.
  * Enrolled virtual machines will disenroll from the IPA server upon
  their deletion via Morpheus GUI

## Authentication

Before proceeding, if you lack a Morpheus API access token, make sure
to check out the [EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/How+to+generate+Morpheus+API+access+tokens)
for steps on how to generate one in a self-service manner.

## Usage

### 1. Configure and apply the template

#### 1.1. Interactive Mode

By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
target EWC environment:
```bash
ansible-playbook ipa-enroll-automation.yml
```

#### 1.2. Non-Interactive Mode

>üí° To learn more about defining variables at runtime and its security consideration, checkout the
[official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

Although not recommended, you can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
`--extra-vars` flag, followed by a `"<input name>=<input value>"` key-value pair.
The flag and its follow up key-value pair must be set for each and every input ([see inputs section below](#inputs)):
```bash
ansible-playbook ipa-enroll-automation.yml \
  --extra-vars "morpheus_api_token_override=abcdef12-34567-890a-bcde-f1234567890" \
  --extra-vars "morpheus_api_url_override=https://hcmp.icsi.eumetsat.int" \
  # ...
  # all remaining input overrides
  # ...
  --extra-vars "morpheus_cypher_ipa_admin_password_override=my-secret-password"
```


### 2. Manually link the Morpheus Workflow to the user-defined Morpheus Domain
> ‚ö†Ô∏è As of 17.07.2025, technical limitations on the side of the
[Morpheus API](https://apidocs.morpheusdata.com/v7.0.9/reference/createnetworkdomain)
lead to unreliable configuration of links between workflows and domains.
As a workaround, manual action over the Morpheus GUI is required.

Finalize the configuration over the Morpheus GUI:

1. Login to the Morpheus GUI of your EWC environment
2. From the top navigation bar, go to `Infrastructure > Network`.
3. Select `Domains` from the sub navigation bar.
4. A table will be displayed in the lower portion of the view port, and
containing details of available domains in your EWC environment. Click on the
edit icon (`üñâ`) on the same row where your defined domain is listed.
5. Within the pop-up edit form, click on the `Select Workflow` drop-down
menu and select `ipa-enroll-automation`. Click on `SAVE CHANGES` at the
bottom of the form to finalize the setup.

## Inputs
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If set, the `update_morpheus_cypher` flag will trigger the creation/edition of secrets within Morpheus Cypher.
To avoid unexpected behavior during IPA clients enrollment, ensure the values of all input secrets (i.e. those with
`morpheus_cypher_` prefix) are set and match to the values used during the initial IPA server configuration in your
 EWC environment.

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| morpheus_api_token_override | access token of the Morpheus API | `string` | n/a | yes |
| morpheus_api_url_override| Morpheus API URL. Examples: `https://morpheus.ecmwf.int`, `https://hcmp.icsi.eumetsat.int` | `string` | n/a | yes |
| morpheus_tenant_name_override| Morpheus tenant name.  Example: `<memberstate>-<organization>-<projectname>` | `string` | n/a | yes |
| update_morpheus_cypher_override | flag to update required secrets in Morpheus Cypher. Only `yes` will be accepted to approve | `string` | n/a | yes |
| morpheus_cypher_ipa_domain_override | name of domain managed by the IPA server. Must match with the value set used during used during configuration of a pre-existing IPA server within the EWC environment. Example: `<memberstate>-<organization>-<projectname>.ewc` | `string` | n/a | yes |
| morpheus_cypher_ipa_server_hostname_override | hostname of the IPA server. Must match with the value set used during used during configuration of a pre-existing IPA server within the EWC environment. Example: `ipa-server` | `string` | n/a | no |
| morpheus_cypher_ipa_admin_username_override | username of IPA Directory Manager/Admin. Must match with the value set used during used during configuration of a pre-existing IPA server within the EWC environment. Example: `ipa-admin` | `string` | n/a | no |
| morpheus_cypher_ipa_admin_password_override | password of IPA Directory Manager/Admin. Must match with the value set used during used during configuration of a pre-existing IPA server within the EWC environment | `string` | n/a | no |

## Final Environment
